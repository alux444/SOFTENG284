constant O(1) < logarithmic O(logN) < linear O(N) < quadratic O(N$^2$) < cubic O(N$^3$) < exponential O(2$^2$) < factorial O(N!)

**Note**
as Big O removes all constants, large constants in an algorithm may not be considered, even though they may be far more relevant to actual running time.

Ideally, we want to find a function G such that:
T = Θ(g)

We write T = Θ(g)
if T = O(g) and g = O(T)

or so that there exists positive constants c (small) and C (large), such that:
`c * g(n) <= T(n) <= C * g(n)`
or T is something like g

T = O(g) - T is at most something like g
T = Ω(g) - T is at least something like g
T = Θ(g) - T is something like g

**Example problem**
Across n buildings of the same width but variable height, calculate the largest possible area for a sign.
Inputs: array `h[1], h[2] ... h[n]` of heights. Assume same width of 10m.

**Solutions**
Complexity O(N$^3$)
**Precise complexity:**
how many times is : `if shortest > h[k]` executed?
= # of triples (i, j, k) such that i < j <= j
= 1 <= i < n/3 <= k < 2n/3 <= j <= n
= n$^3$ / 3$^3$
So n$^3$ is a good estimate
```
largestArea = 0
for i in range(0, n):
	for j in range(i, n):
		shortest = h[i]
		for k in range(i + 1, j):
			if shortest > h[k]:
				shortest = h[k]

		area = 10 * (j - i + 1) * shortest
		if area > largestArea:
			largestArea = area
 ```
 Complexity O(N$^2$)
 ```
 largestArea = 0
 for i in range(0, n):
	 shortest = h[i]
	 for j in range(i, n):
		 if shortest > h[j]:
			 shortest = h[j]

		area = 10 * (j - i + 1) * shortest
		if area > largestArea:
			largestArea = area
```
Complexity O(N)
```
largestArea = 0
for i in range(0, n):
```
