Java Hashing function:
```
public static int stringHashCode(String s) { 
	int h = 0;
	int length = s.length();
	for (int i = 0 ; i < length ; i++) {
		h = 31 * h + s.charAt(i);
	}
	return h;
}
```
Why 31?  - Helps make all numbers contribute to the hash code.
A good hash number shouldn't be even - even numbers would result in many numbers not contributing.
