Problem:
Given an unsorted Array of length n, and integer k, (1 <= k <= n), return the k-th smallest element in A.

Quick Select: 
Average case: O(n)
Worst case: O(n^2)

k-th smallest element: element at index k-1 in the sorted array.

Use a left and right pointer - partition the array such that we have a value of "q" and 2 arrays - on left, smaller than q, on right, greater than q,
this is thereby giving us the exact index for q.

if k-1 > q, we know it is in the right array, and vice versa.

```
def quick_select(A, k) {
	int left = 0
	right = A.length - 1
	while (left < right):
		q = partition(A, left, right)

		if (q == k - 1):
			return A[q]
		elif (k - 1 < q):
			right = q - 1
		else: 
			#if q < k - 1
			left = q + 1

	return A[left]
}
```
