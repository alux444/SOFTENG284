We know that any method run on the tree relies on the height of the tree.
Minimum height of a tree - Log(N)
Leaf - Node with no descendants.

If we say, add numbers 1 to n to a binary tree, it becomes more like a LinkedList.
Can we create an efficient tree?

Rotation - rotate(x) - swapping X with its parent P
![[Pasted image 20230817120013.png]]
We need to check that the resulting tree is also a BST
```
void Rotate(SetNode x) {
	if (x.parent == null) {
		//if x is the root, nothing happens
		return;
	}

	SetNode p = x.parent;
	SetNode g = p.parent;
	p.parent = x;
	if (p.left == x) {
		//if x is the left child of p
		p.left = x.right;
		x.right = p;
	} else {
		// if x is the right child of p
		p.right = x.left;
		x.left = p;
	}

	x.parent = g;
	if (g != null) {
		if (g.left == p) {
			g.left = x;
		}
		else {
			g.right = x;
		}
	} else {
		//x is the new root (no grandparent)
		root = x;
	}
}
```

Trees which try to maintain a small height, through a series of rotations, called Self-Balancing Trees.

AVL trees
Worst case add / remove / find : O(log(N))

Splay trees
Amortised add / remove / find : O(log(N))
