Idea: Maintain the tree height-balanced
Need to update height along the way.

AVL Trees, for each node x: -1 <= height(X.left) - height(X.right) <= 1
height(node) = longest path from the node to a leaf in its subtree
If we have `n` nodes in out BST, then the height of the root is less than `2 log(n)`

Store height in the node
```
class SetNode {
	int key;
	int height;
```

Example:
Identify individual out-of-balance nodes from the latest `add`
Everything that is out of balance is out of balance by just a bit, such that:
`-2 <= height(X.left) - height(X.right) <= 2`
