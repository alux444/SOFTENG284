Idea: Whenever we add or find a node, rotate it all the way to the root.
- But this idea is flawed - a bad case can often happen

Instead: Whenever we add or find a node, Zig-Zag it all the way to the root.

Example: we have zigzag pattern above. So we rotate the node twice.

Example: we have the parent and node in same direction. So we rotate the parent, then the node.

If a node doesn't have a grandparent, just rotate once.

Easier to implement, frequently accessed keys will be close to the root.
