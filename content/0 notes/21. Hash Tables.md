Extension of Set interface

| Returns | Method and Description |
| :-----: |  :-----: |
| void | add(key) - Adds specified key if not present |
| void | remove(key) - Remove key from the set |
| boolean | contains(key) - Returns a boolean for if a set contains the key |

Idea - map keys with very high values to a representative hash.
But this results in collisions - where many keys have the same hash.

Load factor - number of elements in table
When load factor is too large - resize and reinsert

Chaining - have each reference to a linked list instead of a boolean.
Open Addressing - linear probing through keys if a key is taken. Distinguish removed / empty values for contains
