Extension of Set interface

| Returns | Method and Description |
| :-----: |  :-----: |
| void | add(key) - Adds specified key if not present |
| void | remove(key) - Remove key from the set |
| boolean | contains(key) - Returns a boolean for if a set contains the key |

Idea - map keys with very high values to a representative hash.
But this results in collisions - where many keys have the same hash.

Load factor - number of elements in table
When load factor is too large - resize and reinsert

Chaining - have each reference to a linked list instead of a boolean.

Open Addressing - linear probing through keys if a key is taken. Distinguish removed / empty values for contains

Linear probing
0: hash(x) % m
1: hash(x) + 1 %m

Quadratic probing:
Good as we are guaranteed to visit each bucket of the hash table
1: hash(x) + $c_1$ * 1 + $c_2$ * $1^2$  %m
2: hash(x) + $c_1$ * 2 + $c_2$ * $2^2$ %m
Good choice when m = $2^t$ : $c_1$ = $c_2$ = 1/2
