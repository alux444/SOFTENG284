Starting with a freshly initialised data structure, let A(n) denote the total number of operations if we call `op` exactly `n` times
Then, Amortised Complexity of `op` is T$_a$ (n)  = A(n) / n

Note: Sometimes a running time depends on the input parameter, in which case we consider a worst possible sequence of n executions of `op` in terms of the total running time A(n), as in we consider a sequence which maximises A(n).

In amortised complexity, a dynamic array will have add complexity of O(1)
