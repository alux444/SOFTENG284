Problem: 
Sort a given array A in non-decreasing order.

Selection algorithm:
Find the smallest value, swap to first position.
Move to next position, find smallest value, and so on.
```
for i in range(n):
	min_indice = i
	for j in range(i+1, n):
		if A[j] < A[min_indice]:
			min_indice = j
	swap(A[j], A[min_indice])
```
Time complexity
O(n^2)
Easier to implement

Insertion algorithm:
Go through array, insert into correctly sorted position in an array by swapping or shifting array.
```
for i in range(1, n-1):
	current_card = A[i]
	insert_after = i - 1
	while ((insert_after >= 1) and (A[insert_after] > current_card)):
		A[insert_after + 1] = A[insert_after]
		insert_after--

	A[insert_after + 1] = current_card
```
Time complexity
O(n^2)
Faster if the array is almost sorted

A pair of indices i < j form an inversion in A if `A[i] > A[j]` (number of swaps before sorting)
So time complexity here is Î˜(n + number of inversions)
