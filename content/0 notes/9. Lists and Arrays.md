Allows for memory to expand or shrink with requirements.

Single LinkedList
List data structure with a pointer to the next node (next item on list).
Last element on the list will point to null.
O(1) for add and size. O(n) for remove, get and set.

Doubly LinkedList
LinkedList which also has a pointer to the previous node.
The first and last elements will point to null.
O(1) for add, remove and size. O(n) for get and set.

Dynamic Arrays
Once we reach capacity, double capacity and copy content.
O(1) for all operations, except add, which is O(n) based on size.
