In place, O(n logn)

1. Organise data in form of a tree by indices
- first level index 0, second level index 1, 2, third level index 3, 4, 5, 6...
2. Rearrange the array such that no node is greater than its parent (heapify)
- In the array, we would swap those values.

Keep removing max element
1. Remove max element from root, swap with LAST index.
- The last index is now the max, so it is in its sorted position.
3. Fix the tree, selecting the LARGER of the available nodes if swaps are needed.

Resulting array will be sorted in-place

Parent node of index i = `floor( (i - 1) / 2 )`
