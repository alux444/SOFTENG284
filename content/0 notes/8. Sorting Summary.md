| Algorithm | Running time | In-place | Stable |
| :-----: |  :-----: |  :-----: |  :-----: | 
| Insertion Sort | O(N$^2$) | Yes | Yes |
| Selection Sort | O(N$^2$) | Yes | No* |
| Merge Sort | O(NlogN) | No | Yes |
| Randomised QuickSort | O(NlogN) avg | Yes? | No* |
| Counting Sort | O(N) | Yes(bytes) No(obj) | Yes |\
\* - lots of extra memory needed.
? - quick sort with stable results in NOT in place.
In-place : Doesn't need extra array 
Stable : Order of sorting from initial array is maintained

Sorting in Java - java.util.Arrays.sort()

bytes - Insertion and Counting sort
int - Dual pivot QuickSort with tail recursion, Insertion sort and Heap Sort
object - TimSort - heavily engineered hybrid MergeSort (to minimise comparisons with objects, as this is expensive)
