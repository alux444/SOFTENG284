List
- We care about the order in which elements are accessed.
- Fast at:
	- Adding / removing at end of list (LinkedList, DynamicArray)
	- Random access (DynamicArray)
- Slow at:
	- Adding / removing from middle of the list
	- Checking if an element is present in a list

Sets and Maps - usually no duplicates

Set
- We care about if an element is present

Map (Dictionary)
- We care if an element is present and what is it's associated value
