Counting sort
O(N)
Only works for arrays where you KNOW there is a small range of possible values.

Go through array and count every possible value of each integer.
Reassign to array in order, with however much count.

Example with Bytes (Java)
```
static void countingSort(byte A[]) {
	int count[] = new int[256];
	for (int x : A) {
		count[x & 0xFF]++;
	}
	int pos = 0;
	for (int i = 128 ; i <= 128 + 0xFF ; i++) {
		while (count[i & 0xFF]-- > 0) {
			A[pos++] = (byte)(i & 0xFF);
		}
	}
}
```

Stable counting sort
Say we have an element:
```
class Element {
	public int type;
	public String name;
}
```
We count how many elements of each type we have.
The first position of type-0 elements is 0
The first position of type-1 elements is `count[0]`
And so forth.

Code assuming we have 5 types:
```
static void countingSort(Element A[]) {
	Element B[] = new Element[A.length];
	int count[] = new int[5];

	for (Element a : A) {
		count[a.type]++;
	}

	int nextPos[] = new int[5];
	nextPos[0] = 0;
	for (int i = 1 ; i < 5 ; i++) {
		nextPos[i] = nextPos[i - 1] + count[i - 1];
	}

	for (Element a : A) {
		B[nextPos[a.type]++] = a;
	}

	# copy array B to A.
}
```
